[Documentation](http://docs.diesel.rs)

Diesel gets rid of the boilerplate for database interaction and eliminates
runtime errors, without sacrificing performance. It takes full advantage of
Rust's type system to create a low overhead query builder that "feels like
Rust".

## Getting Started

You can find an extensive Getting Started tutorial at
[http://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started](http://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started).
Guides on more specific features will be coming soon.
