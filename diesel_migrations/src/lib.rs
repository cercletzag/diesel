//! Provides functions for maintaining database schema.
//!
//! A database migration always provides procedures to update the schema, as well as to revert
//! itself. Diesel's migrations are versioned, and run in order. Diesel also takes care of tracking
//! which migrations have already been run automatically. Your migrations don't need to be
//! idempotent, as Diesel will ensure no migration is run twice unless it has been reverted.
//!
//! Migrations should be placed in a `/migrations` directory at the root of your project (the same
//! directory as `Cargo.toml`). When any of these functions are run, Diesel will search for the
//! migrations directory in the current directory and its parents, stopping when it finds the
//! directory containing `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! Individual migrations should be a folder containing exactly two files, `up.sql` and `down.sql`.
//! `up.sql` will be used to run the migration, while `down.sql` will be used for reverting it. The
//! folder itself should have the structure `{version}_{migration_name}`. It is recommended that
//! you use the timestamp of creation for the version.
//!
//! Migrations can either be run with the CLI or embedded into the compiled application
//! and executed with code, for example right after establishing a database connection.
//! For more information, consult the [`embed_migrations!`](macro.embed_migrations.html) macro.
//!
